        "We're going to spoil the mystery for you. One cause of distortion in our example is that lines of latitude and longitude do not have a reliable translation into distance. The technical way to say this is that we are trying to treat lat/long coordinates as if they lived on a euclidean (that is, a flat and undistorted) space. But the surface of the earth is a 2d space wrapped around a 3d sphere. The resulting distortion is what qualifies the space as a \"non-euclidean\" space.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, while a single degree of latitude is approximately the same length throughout the world (~69 miles long), a single degree of longitude varies in length depending on the latitude from which measure the length of that longitudinal degree. At the equator, one degree of longitude is about 69 miles long, and that length shrinks as you approach either pole. In Manhattan, longitudinal degrees are about 52 miles long. Distances calculated by our vector database, however, assume that the units of measurement are equal for both dimensions of the vector. The euclidean distance measurement under-counts longitudinal miles compared to latitudinal miles for locations at any distance from the equator.\n",
        "\n",
        "This sort of skewing can be solved with \"feature engineering\" — the mathematical adjustment and editing of features to better suit the task. One example is [converting latitude and longitude values into points in 3-dimensional space](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/29162).\n"
